    Scenario Outline: Install a new product release

      Given a configuration management with "<cm_tool>"
      And a created product with name "${CONFIG_FILE}" and release "${CONFIG_FILE}"

	  | fqn            | hostname        | ip              |
	  | ${CONFIG_FILE} | ${CONFIG_FILE}  | ${CONFIG_FILE}  |
      When I install the product in the VM
      Then the task is created
      And the task is performed
      And the product installation status is "INSTALLED"
      And the product is installed
